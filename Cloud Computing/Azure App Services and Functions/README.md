# Ascend+ Community Content README #

Each sub-folder provides content for one session.  

Each session presentation is intended to last around 45-minutes, allowing time for Q&A if desired.

The sessions should be delivered in order either one event at a time, or as a set during a single event.

Each sessions comes with:
- a PowerPoint deck including notes
- demo instructions including for setup prior to the session and in-session delivery
- where applicable, hands-on-lab (HOL) instructions for attendees, which can be done under presenter supervision during a session, shown as another presentation by the presenter or taken away by attendees
- links to a recording of each demo
- a link to a recording of an example presentation of the whole session
