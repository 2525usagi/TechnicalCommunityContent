Booker T. Washington - The Future of the American Negro

In this volume I shall not attempt to give the origin and history of the 
Negro race either in Africa or in America. My attempt is to deal only with 
conditions that now exist and bear a relation to the Negro in America and 
that are likely to exist in the future. In discussing the Negro, it is always 
to be borne in mind that, unlike all the other inhabitants of America, he 
came here without his own consent; in fact, was compelled to leave his own 
country and become a part of another through physical force. It should also 
be borne in mind, in our efforts to change and improve the present condition 
of the Negro, that we are dealing with a race which had little necessity to 
labour in its native country. After being brought to America, the Negroes 
were forced to labour for about 250 years under circumstances which were 
calculated not to inspire them with love and respect for labour. This 
constitutes a part of the reason why I insist that it is necessary to 
emphasise the matter of industrial education as a means of giving the black 
man the foundation of a civilisation upon which he will grow and prosper. 
When I speak of industrial education, however, I wish it always understood 
that I mean, as did General Armstrong, the founder of the Hampton Institute, 
for thorough academic and religious training to go side by side with 
industrial training. Mere training of the hand without the culture of brain 
and heart would mean little.
