This repo includes teaching materials about Microsoft Azure and other Microsoft technologies, and is available to anyone who wants to use it under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).

The top-level folders in the repo (Advanced Analytics, Cloud Computing, etc.) represent topic areas. Inside the top-level folders are folders containing courseware modules. Each module folder contains a PowerPoint deck and one or more folders named HOL1, HOL2, etc. These folders contains scripted walk-throughs that can be used as demos by a presenter or as hands-on labs (HOLs) for attendees.

The courseware in this repo is currently under development. New modules are being checked in regularly, and existing modules are frequently revised to improve them or stay up to the date with the latest platforms and tools.
