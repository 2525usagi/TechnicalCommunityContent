# Community Content - Introduction to React

This folder contains content introducing React and demonstrating how to use it to build web applications. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Building Web Applications with React (HOL)

The HOL works on any operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux) â€” and may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
